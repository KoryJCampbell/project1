Game of Concentration [Memory]

// AM: With user stories, think about what the user should see when he/she performs a certain action.
// AM: While it's true that when a user successfully picks a pair of matching cards he "wins" that round, but how is that manifested in the application?

Role | Goal | Reason

user | selects a card at random | to start game
user | selects 2nd card to match first card | win or lose
user | picks the correct card | wins a set of matchings cards
user | picks an unmatching card | does not win a set of matching cards
user | selects another card at random | to continue game
