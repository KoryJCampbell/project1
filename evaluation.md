# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. :+1: creating a readme that includes user stories. In the future I suggest including other information that would be helpful to anybody looking at your repo (e.g., installation instructions, challenges encountered).

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations**. You met all the technical requirements and demonstrated a good knowledge of event listeners. I strongly encourage you to implement some logic in this game. As it stands, there is nothing checking if cards are a match or not, which is a crucial component of a matching game. That being said, it looks like you started working on that at the bottom of your script file. I've included some more comments on this in my inline comments. Take a look at the link in the "Code Quality" section below. Please let me know if you'd like to talk about this further.

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**. Solid job. Your indentation and style were consistent. Your code could benefit from some comments explaining what relevant chunks of code do. There are also a lot of opportunities for refactoring and making your code DRYer. Take a look at my inline comments via the link below.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Meets Expectations**. Based on our conversations, sounds like you put a lot of thought into figuring out how to solve this problem. While there is work to be done in the logic department, good job creating a trivia game that manipulates the DOM as it should. Let me know if you have any questions about anything I mentioned here or in the inline code comments.
